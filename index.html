      <p>Firstly, I love <strong>art</strong>, indeed, one of my uncles is passionate about art, so ever since I was a little girl, I have seen him buying paintings at auctions, which has always intrigued me. Visiting museums or exhibitions allows me to learn more about the techniques used in different eras, which fascinates me.

      <h2>History 👩🏼‍🎓</h2>
      <p> <strong>History</strong> is something I've always been interested in, I remember when I was eight years old, I had a book on the whole history of France and I had read it a good ten times aha! So, I love watching historical documentaries and always learn more about many different subjects!</p>
      <h3>The Second Empire period in France with Napoleon II is my favorite historical period</h3>
